# Directory AGENTS — docs

- Keep documentation aligned with the current architecture and product vision; update `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `vision.md`, and implementation plans when behavior changes.
- Reflect linting/quality gates and testing workflows in docs; avoid conflicting guidance.
- Use concise, ASCII-only prose and keep links/paths accurate to the repo structure.
